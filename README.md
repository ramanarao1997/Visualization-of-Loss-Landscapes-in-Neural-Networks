# Visualization-of-Loss-Landscapes-in-Neural-Networks
The project helps in analyzing the behavior of loss functions of neural network models with respect to their parameters. Helps in fine tuning the parameters of the models.
It contains various encodings like scatterplot, heatmap and 3D loss surfaces. 

## Data
Collected dataset of 10,000 loss values corresponding to a parameter set for four neural networks.
Preprocessed the data and converted it from hdf5 format to json.

## How to run
Clone the repository, unzip it and run the 'index.html' file by starting a local server.
or
Run it from here: https://rakula3.people.uic.edu/Final%20Project/Code/
